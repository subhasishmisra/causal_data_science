# Causal inference 101
This is the companion GitHub repository for my talk on the basics of causal inference at Strata NYC'19.
It has the data and codes needed to replicate the case study that the audience has been
walked through as well as useful reference papers for self study. Broadly, the contents include:
1. The dataset used in the talk - data_obv_exp.csv. The data dictionary for this dataset is the data_dictionary.xlsx file.
2. The R code used for running matching procedures in the talk - ODSC_tak_model_final.R
3. A bunch of papers for reading up on causal inference techniques (not just limited to matching !).
